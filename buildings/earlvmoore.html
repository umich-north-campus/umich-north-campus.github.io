            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> The Earl V. Moore Building, which hosts the school of music, was built in 1964. It has several significant additions in 1985 and 2015. In 1985, the McINTOSH THEATRE, which is for opera and musical theatre, was added. In 2015, the WILLIAM K. and DELORES S. BREHM PAVILION, which contains a state-of-the art lecture hall, was built. The school is ranked #3 in the best music schools in the US 2019 ranking.
            </p>
            <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
            <p>There is a balcony outside of the building where people can sit and enjoy the view of a lake. Some students will sit there and chat when the weather is mild. </p>
            <img src="/static/img/EarlVMoore_balcony.jpg" alt="">
            
            <p> There is a library inside the musical school. In the library, there is a large sheet music collection,&#10;                recognized as one of the world&rsquor;s major music collections. It&rsquor;s a quiet library that most people study on&#10;                  their own instead of having discussions for course projects.</p>
            <img src="/static/img/EarlVMoore_library.jpg" alt="">
            
            <p> The view from the windows at the back of the library is beautiful and the seats in that area are
                particularly comfortable. Not many people visit the library most of the time, so there are always some
                seats available during the opening hours of the library. Opening time:</p>

            <p> Some interesting instruments are displayed on an aisle on the 1 st floor of the building. Instruments with
                    the appearance of dragon are displayed. The exhibition also explains how different dragon has been
                    looked upon by European and Asian cultures. European treated dragon as terrible creature that needs to
                    be slayed by heroes while Asian considered dragon a symbol of imperial authority.</p>

            <p> This wall displays different kinds of lutes from all over the world and mentions that many kinds of lutes
                are derived from oud: the ukulele, cavaquinho, guitar, mandolin, and the machete. </p>

            <p> This wall introduces the Columbian organ, which won the unreserved approbation of the world's
                greatest organist. A cut of the Columbian organ is also exhibited.</p>

            <p> There is also a lounge area in this building for students and faculties to eat, collaborate, study, and relax.
                Vending machines, microwave ovens, computers, printers, and seats are provided.</p>
