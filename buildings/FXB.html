            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> François-Xavier Bagnoud (FXB) Building is where the Aerospace Engineering Department locates. The
building was donated by the FXB foundation, which was founded to honor the death of François-Xavier
Bagnoud, an alumnus of U of M. François completed his bachelor’s degree within three years and wrote
“Helicopter Theory for Private Pilots” during his undergraduate. François was passionate about rescuing
people but unfortunately was killed in a helicopter accident on January 14, 1986, less than four years
after his graduation from U of M. </p>
            
            <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
            <p>There are a lot of aerospace related exhibits at the first floor of FXB
This wall exhibits items related to an UM alumnus, Clarence L. “Kelly” Johnson, an American
aeronautical and systems engineer. He is recognized for his contributions to a series of important
aircraft designs, most notably the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird. The wall shows the awards he
received, the books he wrote, and his diplomas from UMich.</p>
