            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud (FXB) Building is where the Aerospace Engineering Department locates. The&#10;building was donated by the FXB foundation, which was founded to honor the death of Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier&#10;Bagnoud, an alumnus of U of M. Fran&ccedil;ois completed his bachelor&rsquor;s degree within three years and wrote&#10;&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Helicopter Theory for Private Pilots&rdquor; during his undergraduate. Fran&ccedil;ois was passionate about rescuing&#10;people but unfortunately was killed in a helicopter accident on January 14, 1986, less than four years&#10;after his graduation from U of M. </p>
            
            <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
            <p>There are a lot of aerospace related exhibits at the first floor of FXB&#10;This wall exhibits items related to an UM alumnus, Clarence L. &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Kelly&rdquor; Johnson, an American&#10;aeronautical and systems engineer. He is recognized for his contributions to a series of important&#10;aircraft designs, most notably the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird. The wall shows the awards he&#10;received, the books he wrote, and his diplomas from UMich.</p>

            <p> The composite fan blade on display is one of the blades that help propel the world&rsquor;s largest jet engine. Its efficient design helps the engine to be one of the most fuel efficient and quietest engines.</p>
