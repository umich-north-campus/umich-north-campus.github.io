            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> In 1957, some of the property located at the north campus that belonged to University of Michigan was sold to Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2000. In 2002, U of M sold additional area to Pfizer. However, those property were sold back to U of M in 2009, and the site was named North Campus Research Complex. The motivation for U of M to purchase the former pharmaceutical research campus was that they wanted to bring scientists and entrepreneurs together, so that research that is done today will be turned into medications, devices and technologies tomorrow.</p>
            <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
            <p> You can even find a gym inside the NCRC buildings. The gym includes locker room, dancing room, and a weight-lifting training room. Shower rooms are also located beside the locker room. </p>
