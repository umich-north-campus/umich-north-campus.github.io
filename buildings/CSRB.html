            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> The department had not be named Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering (Climate &amp; Space or
simply CLaSP) until the late 1960s, it was named Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences (AOSS)
before this change. The rename was caused by adding the disciplines of meteorology and space sciences
to the department of AOSS. AOSS was derived from the combination of the interdepartmental graduate
program in Aeronomy and the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science (AOS) in 1966. The
blending history of individual departments into a large department was to put the department and its
students and faculties at the forefront of research with a whole systemic view which includes the
understanding of the Earth, atmosphere, planets, solar system and space weather. </p>
            <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
            <p> There is a sculpture on the wall in CSRB. It visualizes the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through
            translations of data and scientific models.</p>

            <p> A beautiful yard is surrounded by the CSR building. Tables and chairs are provided for students and faculties to take a rest at this scenery place.</p>
